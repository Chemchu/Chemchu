# Hello everyone! 👋

My name is Gustavo Lee, and I am a software engineer. I completed my degree in Computer Engineering and a master's degree in Software Systems Engineering and Technology at UPV. I have created a couple of video games using Unity and also developed an open-source ERP system using a microservices-based architecture. This latter project can be found in my GitHub repositories.

I work at a multinational company called Sopra Steria, where I am one of the backend developers. I enjoy web development, video games, problem-solving, and playing the guitar.

Thank you for everything! 💞️
